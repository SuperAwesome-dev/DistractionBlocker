Icon Files Needed:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

To create these icons:
1. Open generate_icons.html in a web browser
2. Right-click each icon and save as PNG
3. Or run: python create_icons.py (requires Pillow: pip install Pillow)

For now, you can use any simple PNG files with these names as placeholders.
